# DISQUERY - Distance Query

## 题面翻译

给有 $n$ 个节点的树, 树上边有边权. 再给定 $q$ 组询问, 每次询问两个点路径上的最小值和最大值.

本题中的 $n$ (节点个数) 和 $q$ (询问个数) 范围都是 $1 \sim 100000$.

## 题目描述

[English](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISQUERY/en/) [Vietnamese](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISQUERY/vn/)The traffic network in a country consists of N cities (labeled with integers from 1 to N) and N-1 roads connecting the cities. There is a unique path between each pair of different cities, and we know the exact length of each road.

Write a program that will, for each of the K given pairs of cities, find the length of the shortest and the length of the longest road on the path between the two cities.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000. Each of the following N-1 lines contains three integers A, B and C meaning that there is a road of length C between city A and city B.

The length of each road will be a positive integer less than or equal to 1 000 000.

The next line contains an integer K, 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 000. Each of the following K lines contains two different integers D and E – the labels of the two cities constituting one query.

### Output

Each of the K lines of output should contain two integers – the lengths from the task description for the corresponding pair of the cities.
