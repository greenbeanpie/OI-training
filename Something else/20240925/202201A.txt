For nearly a decade now, Merebeth has been a self-employed pet transport specialist.Her pet transport jobwas born of the financial crisis(危机)in the late 2000s. The downturn hit the real estate(房地产)firmwhere she had worked for ten years as an office manager. The firm went broke and left her looking for a newjob.One day, while driving near her home, she saw a dog wandering on the road, clearly lost. She took ithome, and her sister in Denver agreed to take it.This was a loving home for sure, but 1,600 miles away.Itdidn't take long for Merebeth to decide to drive the dog there herself. It was her first road trip to her new job.Merebeth's pet delivery service also satisfies her wanderlust. It has taken her to every state in the US exceptMontana, Washington and Oregon, she says proudly. If she wants to visit a new place, she will simply find apet with transport needs there. She travels in all weathers. She has driven through 55 mph winds in Wyoming.

heavy flooding and storms in Alabama and total whiteout conditions in Kansas.
This wanderlust is inherited from her father, she says. He moved their family from Canada to Californiawhen she was one year old， because he wanted them to explore a new place together.As soon as shegraduated from high school she left home to live on Catalina Island off the Californian coast, away from herparents, where she enjoyed a life of sailing and off-road biking.
lt turns out that pet transporting pays quite well at about $30,000 per year before tax.She doesn't work insummer, as it would be unpleasantly hot for the animals in the car, even with air conditioning.As autumncomes, she gets restless--the same old wanderlust returning. It's a call she must heed alone, though.Merebethsays, "When I am on the road, I'm just in my own world. I've always been independent-spirited and l just feelstrongly that l mush help animals."
